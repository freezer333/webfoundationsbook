# Foundations of Web Development – Code Examples

This repository contains all the source code examples for the textbook ***Foundations of Web Development***, available at [webfoundationsbook.com](https://webfoundationsbook.com).

The book is a modern, comprehensive guide to web development—from network protocols to full stack application design—designed for college students, instructors, and professional developers alike.

## About the Book

***Foundations of Web Development*** takes a bottom-up, hands-on approach to learning how the web actually works. You’ll build knowledge layer by layer, starting with the fundamentals of internet protocols and progressing through front-end and back-end development, asynchronous programming, and deployment.

Topics include:

* **Networks & Protocols** – What really happens when you click a link: TCP/IP, sockets, and HTTP.
* **HTML, CSS & JavaScript** – Structural markup, styling, DOM interaction, and responsive design.
* **Server-Side Programming** – Back-end logic using Node.js, Express, templating with Pug, and working with databases.
* **Asynchronous Programming** – Callbacks, promises, and `async/await`.
* **Client-Side Applications** – DOM manipulation, event handling, AJAX, and building reactive SPAs with Vue.js.
* **Security & Deployment** – Authentication, HTTPS, and cloud deployment strategies.

Each major concept is accompanied by annotated, working code examples. A single application—a number guessing game—is evolved iteratively through nine versions, highlighting deeper architectural and design concepts at each stage.

## Repository Structure

The code in this repo is organized to mirror the progression of the book chapters. Each folder corresponds to a major topic or a specific iteration of the example application:

Each example is self-contained and includes any necessary dependencies or configuration notes in a `README.md` or code comments.

## Getting Started

To run most examples, you’ll need:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended)
* A modern web browser
* Optionally: [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for managing dependencies

See each folder’s README (where applicable) for setup instructions.
